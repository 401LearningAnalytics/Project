To build a burndown, you usually use story points in vertical axis and sprints in horizontal. This is not possible at this stage, as it was requested iteration burndown for sprint 1. The features of sprint one are not yet completed(e.g. browsing). So i put effort (hours) in vertical axis and dates in horizontal. It was not possible to put story points in vertical (e.g. you cannot caclulate from the excel the story points per day, only calculation of how much hours one story point takes (as calculation). So i made a prediction on when the full sprint would finish (with the features allocated for first sprint). It seems that people do different things (some put story points in vertical axis, other hours for all sprints which is not possible to calculate).</text></co-content>","item","99SZyjVxEeW6RApRXdjJPw","","q0yAj","","","",2016-04-17 13:33:38.649,2016-06-09 08:06:56.46

The biggest exception for me was the Agile planning course - where I hadn't seen some of those techniques before. The assignments were a good way to learn new skills - but I wish there was more variety and consistency (like 1 or 2 assignments of the same size every week as time managing with my job was hard). The forums really filled in a gap as there was a lot of information added by users who are already product managers and they had more specific things to add to the course.

I hope we had more conflicts to solve, related on how to explain the importance of the different agile practices, everything went a bit to well. I understand the goal of having an upbeat practice that shows how it's <em>better this way</em>, but perhaps there was opportunity for more conflict with josh on this at the beginning.</text><text>Having to piece things considering context and intent of the participants in the different videos was the most realistic, even if you couldn't say what you wanted, it was similar to leaving a meeting and thinking of an important question but that window had already closed.</text><text>I found the release burn-down charts the most challenging, there are very different standards and expectations, depending on how do you implement them you need to do some work in a spreadsheet calculating things in multiple columns. And in the end I still wasn't sure if my release burn-downs met the standards expected by the professors and staff of the specialization.</text><text><strong>I will (and already have) recommend this specialization as broadly as I can. I would suggest creating a shorter course for members of dev teams for working on agile projects, it would be a nice innovation and a tool for developers who want to start or be more effective in agile development but can´t or prefer not to commit for a longer course such as this, for example as having a primer before stating a new agile project.</strong></text><text>Other suggestions would include after some milestones, making note of common mistakes and showing the correct or better practices, especially for doing things in practice for the first time such as the burn-downs that were of very different quality (and very different styles that were not necessarily wring but it made it harder to evaluate and compare).</text><text><strong>I'm extremely thankful to the staff for making this specialization as a MOOC, I would have never been able to take a similar course in Alberta for cost and practical reasons, and i'm sure i'm not the one; notice how many learners come form countries like my own Venezuela. Taking this specialization has already have a huge impact on my work and the work of the organizations I participate in.</strong></text><text><strong>\\n\\n</strong></text><text>Assorted random ideas:</text><list bulletType=\"bullets\"><li><text>The internal client was almost too good, lucky them!</text></li><li><text>In the capstone (and specialization in general) there was little talk about working with design teams, testing and perhaps even user testing. I would love to see this expanded in future iterations of the specialization</text></li><li><text>Having to work with a designer o design team on the capstone project would have been incredibly good</text></li><li><text>It seemed that everything was going too well at times, </text></li><li><text>Most of the hard convincing/motivating was done by a member of the staff team that felt as a avatar of you at times. Perhaps including more branching videos to solve smallish conflicts or communication issues would give the learner a lot of the agency and get a feel of those dev team <em>management</em> issues</text></li><li><text>\"loose cannon\" was very good,  it would be ideal to have more of that</text></li><li><text>also quizzes or other form of evaluation on how to solve those branching scenarios</text></li><li><text>We throw a lot of ideas around the videos, but it would probably be prohibitively expensive to expand on those</text></li></list></co-content>","forum","99SZyjVxEeW6RApRXdjJPw","","","fASrHeVgEeWAzxJelNFrFw","","",2016-06-29 15:41:03.928,2016-06-29 15:41:03.928

The instructor staff did a spectacular job, especially in this odd online environment, of getting us the necessary information in an understandable and usable format. I've taken numerous online courses and those in this specialization rank with the best.</text><text>Some of my favorite aspects were:</text><text>-Capstone video format. I really enjoyed the \"story\" format and how our decisions could really change the direction of the project. It really added some realism to the environment and showed how not getting a complete elicitation of requirements is a bad thing.</text><text>-Assignments. They were great and honestly, I would have liked to have more. Deliverables like story boards and others that weren't required would have been nice, especially for someone who is not a software PM.</text><text>-Course correction on the fly. I loved the way Morgan responded almost immediately to fix issues in the course format. Great job.</text><text>-Course materials. The reading material was also great. It wasn't so in-depth that I wasn't able to absorb it in the realistic amount of time I had. It wasn't a textbook, but it was done very well and I'll refer to it in the future.</text><text>-Discussion forums. While I didn't participate alot, they did work for me. I was able to use them as a resource and hope some of my comments may have helped others. I should have used them more.</text><text>-Coursera UI. The UI was a little glitchy at times, but not bad.</text><text>Overall, I really enjoyed this specialization and got exactly what I wanted out of it. I'll recommend it to others and am already starting my next specialization.

You have done a great job, and I really enjoyed my experience with the specialization. </text><text>I was acquainted with the Agile methodology before the course (although on a surface level), and have even used several instruments before in my digital agency, but I never had a chance to dive into it and learn how important it is to use all the tools in a coordinated and sustainable way. I learned a lot of new instruments during the courses, and managed to make my existing knowledge more systematic. </text><text>The favorite part of the experience was the capstone project, it is very nice to see how all the theory gets real and how important all parts of the projects are, especially those, which are usually ignored because the lack of time (unit/acceptance tests, documentation, retrospective meetings). I also liked the quizzes in the first five courses, they really helped to review the new knowledge and arrange the information in a way which makes it easier to remember certain things better. </text><text>I am grateful for the certain flexibility of the courses - I joined the specialization very late, and in order to make it to the Capstone sign up deadline, I had to go over most of the courses in a very short amount of time, and managed to do it with the help of the discussion forums (fellow students kindly doing peer reviews even after they completed the assignments). On the other hand, I managed to complete the Capstone few weeks earlier, I loved that everyone can more or less follow their own speed in the courses. </text><text>There are things which can be improved, of course: for instance, I personally would love to have more assignments, and more difficult ones, especially in the Capstone project. Instead, I could sometimes feel that the assignments became easier closer to the end of the course, some of them being very similar to the previous ones. I also believe, that it would be great not to have only peer reviews, but also at least one review on each assignment from an experienced professional. Especially the comments sections, which mostly consisted of just a few words, rather than a more profound feedback. I also liked the assignments which had certain templates or suggested the tools to use, it helped to save the time on creating the templates on your own, and gave more time to focus on the quality of content provided. The templates would also be a great asset for the course graduates in the future, I think this could be a good and highly valued improvement in future Capstone projects. </text><text>Overall the experience was great, I am sure that the knowledge and some skills gained during the 6 courses will be helpful in the future, and I will recommend the course to those who may potentially be interested. </text><text>Thanks again for the hard work on the specialization, it’s definitely appreciated!</text></co-content>","forum","99SZyjVxEeW6RApRXdjJPw","","","fASrHeVgEeWAzxJelNFrFw","","",2016-06-17 14:32:33.649,2016-06-17 14:32:33.649

I enjoyed the assignments, especially the requirements elicitation phase, wireframe design, and iteration and release burndown charts. For some of the assignments, I had to refer back to earlier course material, which really helped reinforce the learning in my mind.</text><text>- The product was well-chosen. It was simple to understand but also introduced new interactive educational elements that I had really had to think through.- I loved the release planning tool. Has this been white-labeled so other teams can use it? :-)</text><text>- The peer feedback was very helpful during earlier assignments.</text><text>What I thought didn't go well:</text><text>- The assignments got easier and easier as the weeks went by. I found myself putting in a little less effort to just to push through, while I wished I was still learning new ideas.</text><text>- The iteration plan feedback assignments were tricky. I wasn't sure how to evaluate and ended up missing some basic criteria. However, I definitely did learn that the team should not self-assign all the tasks at the beginning, and to double check the previous sprint velocity!</text><text>- The quality of peer feedback declined as the course went on, from multiple sentences to just a \"nice job.\"</text><text>What I'd change moving forward:</text><text>- I'd add more assignments. Perhaps if we were to design more specific screens for the app? Or actually have to review acceptance criteria and tests? I am very eager to dive even more into the details.</text><text>- I'd add more curve balls. They were a nice way to introduce something new into the assignments.</text><text>- Make it more difficult.

I would recommend to the Coursera organizers that you should advise the learners to read the discussions threads, because at the beginning of the course I hardly never read them, and I was surprised of the amount of resolutions, answers, doubts and suggestions I could find in there. In my company there are many teams working using SCRUM, including mine, and since I started the course I have been comparing the reality with the theory, and there are many coincidences and some differences that are interesting to me. From now on I will try to suggest new practices to my team and my department to improve and be more agile!.</text><text>Many thanks to all of you!

I see that there is a software product manager on a team, product owner (Lisa), and three developers. What happens after software would be delivered to customer? Who usually takes care of documenting the reported issues (in case of there are many customers who use the software), and who deals with training customers? Also, I didn't see the participation of UX/UI designers, so developers are expected to deal with software design themselves? </text></li></list><text>Thank you!  </text></co-content>","forum","99SZyjVxEeW6RApRXdjJPw","","","VkCzk-VgEeWQyBIVkjssHw","","",2016-05-03 16:45:36.477,2016-06-09 08:20:03.36

However breaking up study weeks into\\nsmaller tasks meant I could get\\nthrough study requirements when it all seemed overwhelming.

I have learnt how I can apply different processes into\\nmy own work environment and tools I can take away that I can use for different stages of my\\nprojects.</text><text><strong>Favourite parts: </strong>I particularly enjoyed week 4 of the Capstone prioritising\\nrequirements and release planning as it relates directly to my tasks at work. I enjoyed the tests each week of the other modules of the\\nspecialization and progressing with what was learnt and applying that knowledge\\nto the next level. The release Burndown charts\\nwere challenging for me, though overall I enjoyed how to visually represent the\\ninformation correctly, it was fun.</text><text><strong>The overall experience: </strong>Great! – A gradual progress from week to week in the\\nCapstone.

With the last 2 weeks of the Capstone assessments, it is very\\ndifficult to know from other students what was incorrect and how to improve it.\\nI’d like to see at the end of the course perhaps an ‘excellent’ presentation of\\nthe Burndown charts to understand fully if my assessments missed any\\ndetails.  </text></co-content>","forum","99SZyjVxEeW6RApRXdjJPw","","","fASrHeVgEeWAzxJelNFrFw","","",2016-06-26 08:48:04.333,2016-06-26 08:48:04.333

With that assignment, you can’t further probe a customer because it’s a one way dialogue through text.</text><text>I think something that was missing entirely from the course was working with UX / Design. In my experience, UX / Design teams work at a different cadence than back end developers. That interaction, of Product Manager-and-Design team, was missing.</text><text>I felt as though requirements elicitation, or customer development (a la Steve Blank) wasn’t explored as much as I would have liked. It is a deep topic and can probably span several modules or be its own course. For the amount of time and energy I spend trying to ‘get in front of customers’ I felt this specialization didn’t stress its importance enough.\\n</text><text>\\n</text><text><strong>How has this specialization helped you? Where do you think this specialization will take you?</strong></text><text>I already work in Product Management and intended to take this specialization for my own edification. I didn’t anticipate that I would be job searching while taking this course.</text><text>Since I’ve only worked as a Product Manager in one other company, taking this course, in particular the Capstone, gave me the perspective of what it could be like working at another company.</text><text>When I interviewed, one company’s CTOs had asked me, “So, you’re a student at the University of Alberta?” I explained to him that as a Product Manager, I’m constantly learning, constantly trying to hone my skills. This specialization made me stand out amongst other candidates as the company extended an offer of employment to me.  ( I declined it for a different Product Owner opportunity :) ).</text><text>Overall, the Software Product Management Course acts as a comprehensive introduction to the field. The course exceeded my expectations in that I found it far more engaging and thorough than trying to piece together my own curriculum online and through books.\\n</text><text>Many thanks to the SPM staff and my fellow classmates.\\n</text><text>Cheers,</text><text>Lino</text></co-content>","forum","99SZyjVxEeW6RApRXdjJPw","","","fASrHeVgEeWAzxJelNFrFw","","",2016-06-23 22:38:05.673,2016-06-23 22:38:05.673

It has been an effective wrap-up of the theoretical content learned in the previous five courses in this specialization, and the video sessions actually made it quite realistic. The format works very well in my opinion; submitting assignments for peer review and then doing peer review on other's assignments is a very effective way of learning, and I found it inspiring to see the different perspectives and interpretations of the same information.</text><text>In addition I liked the interactive videos, where you choose between multiple options and then the video continues from there. They made me reflect on similar situations from my past, and they also add to the realistic feel of the project. The actors have done a great job.</text><text>I also liked the traps built into the different assignments, e.g. you had to notice the change in velocity from sprint 1 to sprint 2 when doing the release plan for sprint 3.</text><text>Finally, I liked the variety of tools applied: videos, Google sheets, the cool release planning app with interactive post-it's, e-mails etc.</text><text>I wish there had been more of the interactive videos, trying out different dilemmas in how to make a team work effectively together.</text><text>I also found some of the assignments to be somewhat repetitive; we have been doing release burndown charts and reviewed iteration plans a couple of times. Repetition like this is a natural part of iterative sprints, but in this case I would suggest that you increase the expectations from time to time, so that the reviews include gradually more specific checks.</text><text>In summary, this has been a great learning experience. This is my first Coursera course, and it has been a very effective way to get introduced to an area, which was relatively new to me. I am going to look for something to learn next, and I will certainly give this my warmest recommendations.</text><text>Thanks to everybody at the SPM team for doing a fantastic job in pulling all of this together! </text><text>Kind regards</text><text>Paul</text><text/></co-content>","forum","99SZyjVxEeW6RApRXdjJPw","","","fASrHeVgEeWAzxJelNFrFw","","",2016-04-28 08:26:47.862,2016-06-09 08:15:46.296

Special thanks to Morgan for being helpful all the time. </text><text>I was pretty impressed and satisfied with the overall quality, course material, and the way course was delivered to the students. I will summarize my feedback as follows - </text><text><strong><u><em>Favorite Parts </em></u></strong></text><list bulletType=\"numbers\"><li><text><strong>Easy to understand and follow format</strong> - Videos had good content ensuring student engagement and at the same time not overwhelming them. A reasonable amount was covered every week maintaining an easy and steady pace.</text></li><li><text><strong>Quizzes within the videos to reinforce concepts</strong> - Immensely helpful as they would not let you proceed unless you come up with the right answer ensuring you got the concept right.</text></li><li><text><strong>Nicely laid out course material </strong>- Course material was thorough and covered many topics very well. They were structured well too, ensuring that a student is well aware of important initial concept before advancing to the higher concepts.</text></li><li><text><strong>Downloadable notes and glossary for each course</strong> - I personally found them of IMMENSE help. And THANKS a lot for including a pdf for Glossary. Glossary is typically important when you want to quickly revise all the important terms you learnt. Very well thought about addition. </text></li><li><text><strong>Pretty decent assignment most of the times</strong> - Personally I found them easy and a bit boring but they were good enough to help us apply all the concept we were learning. I personally enjoyed creating wireframes, release plans, and iteration/release burn down chart. Would love to see some challenging questions being add up where we have to think out of the box or do our own research.</text></li><li><text><strong>Weekly SPM Tidbits </strong>- LOVE them too and I was really thankful that staff thought about this. Again, a very nice and interesting addition. Really appreciate your efforts on coming up with the material and sending it to us.</text></li><li><text><strong>Best part was a very cordial, helpful, and prompt teaching staff</strong> - Yes, this was the best part. I am taking few more specializations and I have to give it to your team that this is the best student engagement I have seen so far.</text></li><li><text><strong>Quality of videos</strong> - LOVED it! It makes a load of difference when you are looking at a professional quality video (and not an amataeur video shot with poor audio and hazy screens). I was amazed at the professional quality of videos and it was always a delight to click on “start” button and hearing the friendly soothing starting music! </text></li></list><text><strong><em><u>Feedback</u></em></strong>\\n</text><list bulletType=\"numbers\"><li><text><strong>New Concepts </strong>- Introducing some new concepts that are surfacing in the Industry like DevOps and how they are in alignment or different from Agile would prepare students to have a peek in the future of Agile.</text></li><li><text><strong>Monitoring a product after launch</strong> - While the course was very helpful in covering most of the aspects of a PM’s role during inception, design, implementation, and release phase, one important role is monitoring and gathering analytical data after launch. Adding a course or module on running experiments to measure specific metrics as well as overall success metrics like user engagement, retention, and revenue would have been a great value add. Ideally, I would add one more course or a big section on this topic and add many more points like how PMs can measure success of a product by different means and then use the data to optimize the product for second version. </text></li><li><text><strong>Grading and Feedback Quality</strong> - Though assignments were cleverly designed and rubric system was very well made to reduce any chances of mis-grading, I feel that there were times when grading was a bit erroneous. Despite a perfect and absolute answer, I noticed mis-grading at least on 3 occasions. This would not make much difference when there are three evaluations but when we have only 2 evaluation then this will significantly make a big difference. Also, unfortunately feedback quality on assignments was very poor. Despite Coursera making sure that evaluation is not complete without providing a feedback, feedbacks were just limiting to one or two words (nice, great!) and in some cases just to a dot to bypass this requirement. I understand that it’s hard to find time in our busy schedules to write at length but may be in the exchange of some recognition a decent feedback could be achieved. For example, writing a short recommendation for the students on LinkedIn who provide consistently good feedbacks. </text></li><li><text><strong>Including some thought provoking questions</strong> - Honestly speaking, I found most of the assignments and quizzes very simple and easy to do. Assignments and quizzes should be thought provoking and require some amount of research work. This is a PM specialization course and one of the aspect of a good PM is a thorough research work. A course is a good place to start this kind of research. One assignment could be - Research how PM role varies between different big companies. There is tons of information available online on this topic and a student can come up with some nice informative write ups. During this process student will gain the knowledge what to expect in a PM role in industry’s major companies and also during peer reviews we will learn different perspective on this topic. Assignment like these will force students to do their own research and think out of the box (and not just apply the knowledge they are learning during coursework to complete an assignment). Another question I can think of - Which one is your best product (mobile or web) and why do you like it? </text></li><li><text><strong>Estimation and Pricing</strong> - Depending on where you land, one of the aspect of a PM is to come up with an estimate and pricing for his product. I understand that this is a wide topic and might be out of scope for this course but adding a section on different types of pricing models and explaining briefly how to do estimate planning would be a great add on for students. Just touching the topic superficially and adding few bullet points will give students enough material to dig the topic further. Things that can be added are - What is a business model? What is online Monetization? What is Mobile Monetization? </text></li></list><text><em><strong><u>Capstone Project</u></strong></em></text><text>The part that really kept me engaged was an interesting project and design of capstone. I felt like a part of team and enjoyed various activities like requirement elicitation, designing wireframes, planning releases, and plotting burndown charts. It was a clever idea to clearly include personas with various roles and make us feel like we are actually part of the team. Interactive videos were very nicely done. However, I do feel that assignments could be more challenging. More work could be added in the capstone to make it even more effective. I also think that staff should provide correct versions of burndown charts (iteration as well as release) along with some analysis because there were many confusions on these assignments and while doing peer review I saw many versions of charts. In summary, capstone was beautifully planned but there is scope for adding more details and some challenging work. </text><text>Thanks again!</text><text>Priyanka</text><text>\\n</text></co-content>","forum","99SZyjVxEeW6RApRXdjJPw","","","fASrHeVgEeWAzxJelNFrFw","","",2016-06-27 07:18:57.657,2016-06-27 07:21:13.256

I could certainly recognize situations form real life (requirements never come crystal clear or organized, requirements change, people are temperamental, or don't feel recognized) and it was good to find validation. Furthermore, the reading app it is a lovely and engaging product, and definitely at a company where I would love to work full time!</text><text>I found it particularly challenging to get the release burndown charts right. I guess I understood the concept alright in the lectures, but when I had to do the charts I had to go over the explanations again a few times until it all made sense. I think I edited my submission about 5 times until I got it right (all in all, it made a great experience and I will definitely not forget how to do one!). And judging from a few of the submissions I marked, it seems like this is a particularly challenging area that might benefit from a few more practical exercises in course 4 of the specialization.</text><text>I have also had more than one opportunity to apply concepts and practices from the course to the real world (measuring velocity, writing user stories, prioritizing), making an impact at my current role.

I have learned a lot of specific principles and techniques of being agile, running a software project, as well as getting from the client and translating requirements to the development team. To top it off, the Capstone really helps reinforces what we learned by giving us a real-life-like scenario to practice on. By having the hands-on assignments and the interactive videos, I get to really see how much I have learned from this course as well as how others are perceiving the knowledge I have gained.I really appreciate Morgan and the staff for putting all of this together into a specialization. This isn't an easy feat. The team has also been really diligent in responding to any questions and concerns we have, which provides a great learning experience.The only thing I have to suggest is providing alternate rubrics for some of the assignments. As mentioned by the team, there's no one correct answer for some of the assignments. Yet, in order to pass the assignments and the course, I feel like I had to edit my responses to fit what the rubrics ask for a couple of times (even though I don't see anything wrong with the answers I provided). On some of the assignments, like the evaluations of the iteration plans, we have to look for certain criteria. Yet, at least some of us won't have the background knowledge to know to look for that. I'm guessing that's part of the learning process where we can learn what we should look for in the iteration plans? If so, that would make sense.At the end of the day, I'm really glad I took this specialization. I hope it will prepare me to be a software product manager and a good one. I'm currently a software developer but have strong interest in leading a development team through software projects. I'm also interested in understanding the \"why\" of what we do as developers. I wasn't quite sure of the right career for me until I saw the offering of this specialization. I decided to take it, and I have just learned so much. After this specialization, I will continue to work to try getting to doing software product management one day. This has been a really interesting specialization - thank you Morgan and the team for all the hard work and dedication!</text></co-content>","forum","99SZyjVxEeW6RApRXdjJPw","","","fASrHeVgEeWAzxJelNFrFw","","",2016-04-25 23:06:42.999,2016-06-09 08:13:52.543

In my release plan, I have purposely put Audio Connection (one of the 4 stories) in the second sprint, so I know I will lose a point for my grade.</text><text>However, I strongly believe this should be the case. The reason is Audio Connection is dependent on the Connect with Remote User story (which has no dependencies on its own). I don't believe that the 2 stories where one depends on another (i.e. user story A depends on B) should be placed on the same sprint. If B ends up taking the whole sprint to complete, then A will not get a chance to be completed. At the same time, a potential story with no dependencies could have been completed but couldn't under the grading rubric's ideal release plan.</text><text>Can someone please explain why the Audio Connection and Connect with Remote User stories should be in the same sprint (I know they are both high risk and should be completed as soon as possible, but my reasoning is in the above paragraph)?

There are a few projects I have\\nbeen on; that I believe would have ended more positively, if a basic wireframe\\nprototype had been drawn upfront.</text><text>-         \\nThe meaning of delivering the right product, done\\nright and managed right.</text><text>-         \\nThe entire clients’ needs and requirements\\ncourse, taught me the difference between eliciting requirements vs to just  getting requirements, as well as the skill to\\ndocument the requirements correctly and the importance of removing all ambiguity.</text><text>-         \\nThe planning tools such as release plans and internal\\nplans and the associated burndown charts are an effective way to know the state\\nof my projects and to implement contingency plans as soon as a slippage is\\nforeseen.</text><text>-         \\nI learned that when it comes to engaging with\\npeople and projects, there is not only one right way, each of us are unique and\\nhave different ways of doing things, however, as long as the right principles\\nand methods are applied, we will all achieve success.</text><text>  </text><text><strong><u>What would I do differently?</u></strong></text><text>1.      \\nI would have liked to have spent more time on my\\nassignments, working on a difficult project over the course period; I only\\nstarted each week on a Saturday / Sunday.</text><text>It would be more helpful, if I spread the\\nvideos and tasks over a week.</text><text>2.      \\nPerhaps, a suggestion for the future, in the\\ncourse, it is mentioned that a product managers role comprises of different\\nroles, it would be nice if there was a linked course that contained the\\nmarketing, and  business side of this\\nfunction.</text><text>3.      \\nAt the outset, there was quite a bit of\\nconfusion around the creation of the backlog (list of user stories). It would\\nhave been great if we had received a list of suggested / or recommended users\\nstories as an example so that we can learn a correct way to ensure we get the\\nright requirements, documented correctly. </text><text>4.      \\nI found that sometimes the grading did not\\nreflect whether the assignment was 100% correct.

I have a lot to say about this specialization along with the capstone project :)- What I liked about it:</text><list bulletType=\"numbers\"><li><text>Preparation. All courses and capstone projects were prepared carefully and professionally. I am registered in two other specializations, and I am suffering from this issue. </text></li><li><text>Instructors cooperation. In almost all courses I took/am taking on Coursera, the instructor(s) never replied to our questions. It's like she/he prepared the course and disappeared! She/he never cares if we understood the material. In this specialization, it was the complete opposite. Morgan and Bradley were really cooperative. They answered our questions in a timely manner. They were really helpful.</text></li><li><text>Material. Most courses do not provide any material at all. They told us to read something on the internet or download some slides that are barely useful. In this specialization, there is, for every course, a well-written material. I printed each and read them line-by-line. There was glossary for each course too. I love glossaries; they wrap everything up in my mind.</text></li><li><text>Assignments. Almost all assignments and quizzes were clear enough. </text></li><li><text>Course Flow. The first five courses were easy to follow. Subjects were clear, and I was very interested in the following course once I finished a previous one.</text></li></list><text>- What I hoped:</text><list bulletType=\"numbers\"><li><text>Subtitles. It would be nice if these can be in Arabic too. I don't have a problem with English at all, but I know many friends who would like the courses to be subtitled in Arabic.</text></li><li><text>Capstone project. It was well-prepared and organized. However, I was confused in some assignments. Reviews by peers were wrong in some cases which made me a bit angry. I wish I could have flagged some reviews as wrong/inappropriate.</text></li><li><text>Both Morgan and Bradley were great. I just felt in some videos that Morgan was reading from a screen not illustrating to me.</text></li><li><text>This is a bit technical. I have read more about Agile during the course. One of the greatest book I have read was Learning Agile (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Agile-Understanding-Scrum-Kanban/dp/1449331920\" title=\"Link: http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Agile-Understanding-Scrum-Kanban/dp/1449331920\">http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Agile-Understanding-Scrum-Kanban/dp/1449331920</a>). The theory and philosophy of Agile was brought-up clearly in this book. I felt that Agile is more than the practices introduced in the courses. In fact, here and there in the courses, there were some points that totally contradicts with Agile values. I don't remember them now, of course. Even in the book, it was stated clearly that many new practitioners jump into practices skipping principles and values. Practices are fun and values appear to some as boring. May be this is why the course was also focused on practices more. Anyhow, if more values of Agile can be explained in the courses in a fun way, it would be more helpful for new learners. After all, practices will change, but I doubt the Agile values will.</text></li></list><text>Thank you a lot, guys.

Peers made comments in our Google docs, which was great.  I think I read somewhere, maybe in a response from Morgan in the discussions,  that we were asked to not remove the comments until we were done with the capstone project (even then I probably wouldn't remove them).   </text><text>What's not clear to me, is it OK if we update our requirements?  At first thought it seemed obvious that we should correct and update our requirements doc as the class progressed.  But if I do that in mine, the comments from others won't make sense anymore (they could be for a requirement that has since changed).  So that little conflict has me wondering if we should update the requirements or not.  </text><text>That in turn makes me wonder if there is any advantage to updating the requirements document, since the people in the virtual scenario will of course not know what we wrote anyway  :-) </text></co-content>","module","99SZyjVxEeW6RApRXdjJPw","axsNt","","","","",2016-04-02 20:56:19.681,2016-06-09 07:54:34.644
