I therefor took this course mainly for two reasons:</text><text>a) to get this certificate as a utility for better opportunities to get a job I really enjoy</text><text>b) to refresh my knowledge (and to learn a trick or two, that I did not know before)</text><text>Regarding these two goals, the experience of this course and capstone project has been quite enjoyable for me. I did like to see the video material. It has not been so much receiving new knowledge, but it was a valuable refresher and quite fun to watch the material. It helped me to remember (and hopefully to remember again, when I will experience a challenge during the coming projects) and to reinforce the agile mindset.</text><text>I really appreciated to get some written material (course notes in pdf), so that I did not have to make too much notes but just a few screenshots and remarks. That helped me a lot in the capstone, and it will help me in the future to remember some details.</text><text>In my opinion, the assignments where not such hard, so it was quite fun to do the work and see the results towards the final goal. The only parts I had difficulties with where the parts when it depended on the English language, for example the subtle differences within the wording of requirements. During the capstone,  sometimes I had to replay the videos a few times to understand the sentences of the actors, but that is ok - and the subtitles helped a lot, too.</text><text>I really enjoyed the work during the capstone. It was \"like real life\", and using the stuff we had learned during the courses was such a joyfull experience. I wish I would find other courses / capstone projects like that and I certainly will keep an eye on future courses on coursera.</text><text>Finishing the \"project\" of the capstone really motivated me again to progress with some of my personal software projects I have had in the backlog of my head, and certainly I will start them in the near future and will use the methods of this course to further train the skills and to reinforce the knowledge gained during this courses.</text><text>I would recommend that course to anyone interested in project management and software development. A lot of thanks to the team, you did a great job. 5 Stars from me! </text><text>PS: Just a tiny thing that may be improved: as it is sugested several times, sometimes there is not a single right answer. In that cases, the checklist for the peer review of the assignments should take this into account and be  less strict. For example, the planning of the releases can differ, but none the less the planning is not really wrong. Just a tiny remark from my side.</text></co-content>","dYS2AwkaEeau9AoaFBtgPw","",2016-04-24 14:50:02.70,2016-04-24 14:50:02.70

It doesn't have to be grandiose in scale and if you feel you are lacking in certain skills, recruit a good friend or co-worker that just wants to do something fun and add to their portfolio to help you build. Most importantly, <em>never</em> give up in finding work as a PM working on a product you'd use frequently and is meaningful to you! </text><text>To your question, Katerina-- biggest challenge as a Product Manager...  I'd say for me it has been influencing a change in organizational ways of thinking which really boils down to building group consensus on what tools and methodologies to use, and, most importantly actually carrying out what you're supposed to do with them! I say this as I think it impacts some of the most difficult things we as PMs do-- shipping a product, building a product, etc. etc. It is very easy for people to say they want to be \"user-driven\" (because who doesn't!) but sometimes when rubber meets the road, people just don't do it, especially in startups because of time/money/effort constraints and all the rule books get thrown out the window :-) </text><text>I think, as usually is the case, the technology side of things outpaces the rest of the pack and the business side of things is still playing catch up. Right now for most companies there is a pretty dramatic rift between development and everything else.</text><text>Throughout the specialization, we've focused a lot on Agile development methodology for getting a software product built. On the business side of things to match, you have things like the Lean methodology which I personally love but have found that industry acceptance of it is still growing (in fact, in business school I had a teacher that somewhat dismissed Lean as a \"fad\" but did see merits in it (it was less than 2 years old at the time)). </text><text>If you are familiar with Lean methodology and the concept of Minimum Viable Product (or MVP), when applying Lean principles in a group that may or may not understand Lean, there are A LOT of varying perspectives around both the M (minimum) and the V (viable). </text><text>I found it's easy to get into the \"eternal hamster wheel\" of \"adding just this one more feature I heard about from 1 customer call/read about that is going to send our Net Promoter Score through the roof before shipping!\" in non-flat corporate hierarchies. Generally this is also coupled with going on gut instinct.</text><text>I think the remedy for this as a PM is displaying strong leadership skills with an unwavering commitment to change and learning and spreading that enthusiasm among peers. Unfortunately this isn't automatic so it just takes tons of time and you just have to stick with it :-) I haven't been PM'ing long enough to know if this works per se but the nice shortcut, as you mentioned Katerina, is making sure you are joining a great team that's relatively all on the same page :-) Anyone have thoughts or experience on this?</text><text>And how about for you, Katerina?

Usually, during project Product/Project Manager decides which practices to use and which not, since not all would be efficient for his team. Then, as project goes by some useful practices are adopted to project, some new practices might be tried for some gaps and what is not working is left behind. One more thing: retrospective meetings are lessons learned and are used to adopt methodologies from already finished project to a new projects, because we already know what is went right and what is went wrong in project that is finished, so we learn from it.

In depth knowledge of agile software planning, considering the fact that I have to do it by myself I think that I got basics.\\n2. Agile metrics and reviews for successful sprint planning, very interesting and challenging.\\n3. In depth knowledge of software processes, with focus on Agile practices - this is my personal value.\\n\\n<strong>My Favorite Parts, based on participation:</strong>\\n1.\\n Creating release planning every week, aligned with customer's desires \\nwas very good since most of the projects in real world are not fixed, \\nbut constantly changing also if Customer is constantly changing his mind\\n it is a real challenge. Using associated tool was easy and I really \\nenjoyed using it and making different views of release plan.\\n2. Creating wireframe with free tools was easy and fun\\n3.\\n Iteration burndown and iteration planning of work was very interesting,\\n let me understand what is going well in project, what needs to be fixed\\n in order to achieve initial sprint planning.\\n\\n<strong>Overall experience:</strong>\\n1.\\n I would say wonderful experience with this specialization. I work in \\ncompany, that now acquires Agile and it was very interesting to explain \\nall things that happen and who is responsible for what.\\n2. Tasks are well defined and well spread across 6 weeks.\\n3. Pure practice experience were gained with Capstone project\\n4. Good idea to add review to other classmate's work, thus I can measure my own progress and get what is done well and what not.\\n\\n<strong>Considering things that might be improved, from my own experience with SPM Specialization:</strong>\\nI\\n have just one thing that I think can be done better: Better and \\nadditional explanation to release burndown - this part was the hardest \\none to me, since team's velocity is not constant and adding or removing \\nrequirements is making planning harder, since release planning is \\nchanged based on that.  Also customer's mind is changing and considering\\n low priority tasks as important to enter next release. Maybe adding \\nsome more explanation in relevant tasks: what needs to be done, in what \\nterms, what is expected as result and what others are going to revise. I\\n discovered important things that I have missed while reviewing other \\nclassmates' work.</text></co-content>","qgabzzMNEea88hLQJKBf0w","",2016-06-23 08:27:15.081,2016-06-23 08:27:15.081

I actually commented my point of view in one of my peer reviews, and then I saw that some design decissions are required by the assessment to be present as user stories.</text><text>From my point of view (at least this is what I've been doing so far in the projects I've worked), design features, like layout, pictures and colors, are not functional requirements, but some other constraints to consider as part of the definition of  done for UI related stories. For example, I can implement a list of books in may ways. If I have to show the picture of the book, that does not change what I have to develop in the product. Is just a way to present the data. The same for the other two points.</text><text>A different thing is when i have a feature already implemented, and I want to change the way the data is presented. So, if my list of books is shown without pictures, it is already part of the product, and I want to change the product to show pictures, I would create that requirement as a user story. Why? Because in this case I need to modify an existing feature in the product. But if I am starting development, this design constraints are part of the acceptance criteria for the functionality I have to implement (in my opinion), since I am starting from the scratch and I can present the data as I want from the beginning. Why would you create a story to implement a list of books shown with a given appearance, and then create another one to change that appeareance? If there's nothing implemented yet, you can have only one story that presents the data as you want.</text><text>So I don't think they should be stories, and the criteria to evaluate the assignment seems a bit weird to me in this point, because two of the questions in the evaluation are related to this.</text><text>Let's see if someone from the staff can give us their point of view :)</text><text>Thanks! </text><text>EDIT: after being graded, my submission gets an 8 because of these different points of view.

It's clear that people have different points of view on this, and that's why I said this is subjective :)</text><text>I also think I have very clear the distinction between design and requirement, and I have a different opinion on how to elicit requirements and turn them into user stories than you ;)</text><text>For seeing pictures or not, even if I agree with you on when to consider some feature a user story, why would you have two stories? One story for implementing the logic and one for designing the UI? </text><text>From my point of view, I can do both (implementation and design) in one story, and that's what I reflected in my document. However, the grading requires two.</text><text>If we need two stories to fiish the work the user <strong>must </strong>see, how can we consider \"done\" any of them? Each story will cover half the work, from the user perspective: one for implementing the list, and rendering it some way, another one for polishing the design and render the data the way the user wants to see it.</text><text>Why would we consider that we are scoring points with each story if any of them is not what the users want? I don't see them \"very independent\". Story one implements the list, but is not shown the right way. Story two shows a UI as it has to be, but there's no implementation. i don't see any of those stories can be \"done\", since we are not completing what we need in any. For me, a user story covers all work for a feature as it is needed by the user. As I said, if I am changing the design of something that already exists, I would need a story just for the design. If I am starting development, I prefer to cover everything with only one story: implementation and design are part of the same story.</text><text>Apart from this, I think these aspects are subjective, because different people (as we can see in this thread) have different ideas on  how to get the functionality (and design) done. We're not saying that we won't cover the requirement for the pictures, we're just saying that what is considered two separate stories for some people, is covered with one only story (which would have different acceptance criteria) by others. And in both cases the product will meet the requirements.</text><text>Regards, and thanks for your input!</text></co-content>","4bJSM_TrEeWfohJ0hvQveQ","iJlG8vUwEeWB9gr2ttYzXQ",2016-03-29 07:41:14.897,2016-03-29 07:48:32.16

From an agile perspective, and from my point of view is a bad practice. </text><text>If \"story 2\" depends on \"story 1\", at first sight it might make sense to place them in the same sprint because they're similar. But this can lead to a lot of problems.</text><text>What if \"story 1\" gets blocked by whatever reason? You have not only one story blocked, but two, since \"story 2\" depends on \"story 1\" to be finished. Now imagine the situation is not solved during the sprint. Two stories planned and none of them done. The sprint would be really bad in terms of points scored. And that affects the release.</text><text>Another problem: let's say \"story 1\" requires a piece of software (let's call it \"Class A\") and \"story 2\" also requires the same piece of software (that would be pretty common, being stories related to each other). We fall in a scenario where two developers (or two pairs) are writing the same piece of code, which will lead to synchronization issues (merging code, deciding which implementation is better, changing the rest of the code that was relying on the discarded implementation...)</text><text>What do we do in this case? If there's no enough transparency in the team, we might not find this issue until the development of that common piece is almost done. Or, if we find it, we have to stop \"story 2\" until \"story 1\" is done. What if these stories are the last ones started in the sprint? Nothing else to do, unless we take something from the next sprint. And that's not a good idea, because when \"story 1\" is finished, we have to restart \"story 2\", and stop the one taken from the next sprint...</text><text>As you can see, there are a lot of scenarios that might happen when having depending stories in the same sprint.</text><text>One principle I would take always in account is: always remove as many dependencies as you can. Dependencies between teams (if many teams working in the same product), and dependencies between stories in the same sprint.</text><text>If there are two depending stories that depend on each other, and are similar, you might consider merging them into one, if possible. </text><text>Cheers!</text></co-content>","y-bf8vt8EeWS4Ar9qFG8UQ","",2016-04-09 16:24:12.152,2016-04-09 16:25:33.024

You did a really great job of putting this together.\\n\\nI would have to say my favourite part was the peer reviewing - I learned a lot from seeing how other people did things. The different perspectives widened by knowledge.  \\n\\nI really liked the simulation videos.  Seeing a bit of 'attitude' made me feel right at home with what I've seen in the dev world.  I once fired a contract developer who refused to test his program so I had to laugh at that one.  \\n\\nI also really liked the iteration planning tool. I would have liked to be able to slide user stories in between others though. Ans it seemed to me the order was upside down - with the ones at the bottom appearing at the top in the pdf.  I think a change there or some clarity would have been useful.\\n\\nAnother challenge I had apart from having to redo assignments, was the burndown chart.  I drew it out on paper but I would have loved to use a tool.  I should have checked the forum to see if anyone posted something about free tools to use.\\n\\nAnother thing I got a real kick out of is that when I went to the Coursera Accomplishment page, it posted information right on my LinkedIn profile.  It says 'Verified' too which looks really professional and makes me feel even better about having spent the money on the course. I did this for every course in the specialization and it looks awesome.  I don't know what will happen with this course but I hope to be finding out very soon!\\n\\nAfter I completed the other courses I studied for the scrum.org course.  I bought 3 sample tests online and then wrote the PSM 1 course and passed!!  Everything I learned in the specialization helped a lot.\\n\\nThanks again to Morgan for her help!

So for instance I used to work for mobile OEM's there were only a few people who had both hardware software skills, no project managers, there was always constant pushing back and forth with planning and especially Bugs or trouble shooting. Having the insight of hardware development would help planning software sprints, if you were to work combined projects.</text><text>But the leap of faith to pure software management, will take time demonstrating these news skill acquired in this course.

For example, edit your story about \"listening\" to include the magic phrase \"voice recognition\". This will help ensure reviewers score you correctly.
