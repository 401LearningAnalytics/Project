The velocity is always calculated based on the last sprint and the velocity of that sprint is 16 not 18 , so they cannot finish in 2 sprints. Of course they can push their selves to do more work, but that is a risky approach and certainly not sustainable if you need these developers in the long run."

A bit long as I don't have time right now to carefully edit the text.\\n\\n# Release Burn-down chart:\\nRemember that this is different than the iteration burn-down chart, this confused me before a lot. \\n\\n# The prediction line:\\n\\nWhat's not: The prediction line is not the same as a trend line of remaining or work done, neither is it the graph of the total accumulated amount of fork on that sprint.\\n\\nWhat it is: It's just a line starting at the total amount of story points in the first sprint and ending in 0 story points the next sprint after development is supposed to end; if it's a \"moving bottom\" burn-down graph then consider that the starting and end points are relative to that moving bottom\\n\\nWhat it means: it's a  representation of the ideal work to end the project considering current knowledge of the amount of history points. It helps us know if the project is behind schedule considering the total amount of work to do now (the prediction line can start at a different height than remaining work at sprint 1).\\nIf the remaining work is over the prediction line, we are behind.\\n(We might not be able to make it as it stands because we decided to add a bunch of stories, that's not a judgement on how fast we were developing before the additions.)\\n\\n#Types of chart\\nRemaining vs done work and moving bottom. Both tackle the problem of changing in story points in different ways.\\n\\n## Moving bottom\\nIn moving bottom, there is a bese reference (horizontal) line that is moved to represent the current total story points vs the initial. If there are five net more story points, the reference \"bottom\" line is at -5, this means that you have to go down an extra 5 points to reach the new base or bottom; if there are less total story points it is moved up, so it's easier to reach the \"bottom\".\\nHow it can be graphed: there are many ways but i liked charting  _stacked columns graph_  with: \\n1.- remaining work —done work in sprint n is the difference between remaining work at the beginning of sprint n and n+1 —\\n2.- Accumulated user story change (inverted as described above) in the first order of the stack so that it's always next to the x axis.\\na.- An horizontal line (some software support a reference line as a graph parameter) placed at the point of the  Accumulated user story change to represent the new bottom\\nb.- A manually placed arrow from the top of remaining work at sprint 1 to the bottom reference at sprint n+1 (could be done an additional line series that doesn't stack and adjusting it's parameters to represent  the desired line)\\n\\n## done vs remaining\\nIn done vs remaining we wont move the bottom and the changes in story points are just added to the respective sprint (if the change is done at the end of sprint n, this will be reflected at the beginning of n+1).\\nWe differentiate the work done in a sprint from the change in user stories by stacking the done work on top of the remaining one. We do this using a _stacked column graph_.\\n\\nSo at the beginning of sprint 1 it should be only remaining work, in sprint 2 remaining work dropped by the number of completed story points and we stack a column of the height of the work done. The total height should clearly be the same, all the way to the end when we have only done work and zero remaining work, it looks like done work eats a part of the remaining work each sprint.\\n\\nWhen story points are added or removed from a sprint, the remaining work reflects at the time of the change. For example if I add 5 story points at the end of sprint 1, the remaining work bar is 5 points taller than it should be on sprint 2 onwards (pre_remaining - prev_work + change_story_points) since work done is the same size as it used to, the total height of the column in sprint 2 is now 5 points taller – this is what signifies the increased effort in points – if we remove story points, then the total height will be lower than the preceding sprint.\\n\\n\\nI hope this helped clearing some common pitfalls . \\nPlease disregard typos of grammar in this text as I wrote it in what little time I had today to help peers before the looming deadlines, and didn't had time for a simple proofread"

It is or is not a good practice to assign developers all user stories' tasks?  From Agile Planning for Software Products course notes, Module 3 (planning), Iteration plans, page 61, I quote: \\n\\n \"6. The development team must sign up for tasks.\\nIn iteration plans, tasks are self-assigned. This means\\nthat managers do not assign tasks to members of the\\ndevelopment team, but rather, developers choose to\\nwork on what they find interesting. This generally results\\nin more satisfied workers, and better software.\"\\n\\nand if you check the iteration plan the notes has as example (page 62 and 63) you see all the tasks have been assigned to someone. Therefore, this is a bit contradictory with what Kevin and Rene are suggesting.\\n\\nAs a Project Manager, I'd be concern if tasks are not assigned to someone at the beginning of the iteration."

A bit long as I don't have time right now to carefully edit the text.\\n\\n# Release Burn-down chart:\\nRemember that this is different than the iteration burn-down chart, this confused me before a lot. \\n\\n# The prediction line:\\n\\nWhat's not: The prediction line is not the same as a trend line of remaining or work done, neither is it the graph of the total accumulated amount of fork on that sprint.\\n\\nWhat it is: It's just a line starting at the total amount of story points in the first sprint and ending in 0 story points the next sprint after development is supposed to end; if it's a \"moving bottom\" burn-down graph then consider that the starting and end points are relative to that moving bottom\\n\\nWhat it means: it's a  representation of the ideal work to end the project considering current knowledge of the amount of history points. It helps us know if the project is behind schedule considering the total amount of work to do now (the prediction line can start at a different height than remaining work at sprint 1).\\nIf the remaining work is over the prediction line, we are behind.\\n(We might not be able to make it as it stands because we decided to add a bunch of stories, that's not a judgement on how fast we were developing before the additions.)\\n\\n#Types of chart\\nRemaining vs done work and moving bottom. Both tackle the problem of changing in story points in different ways.\\n\\n## Moving bottom\\nIn moving bottom, there is a bese reference (horizontal) line that is moved to represent the current total story points vs the initial. If there are five net more story points, the reference \"bottom\" line is at -5, this means that you have to go down an extra 5 points to reach the new base or bottom; if there are less total story points it is moved up, so it's easier to reach the \"bottom\".\\nHow it can be graphed: there are many ways but i liked charting  _stacked columns graph_  with: \\n1.- remaining work —done work in sprint n is the difference between remaining work at the beginning of sprint n and n+1 —\\n2.- Accumulated user story change (inverted as described above) in the first order of the stack so that it's always next to the x axis.\\na.- An horizontal line (some software support a reference line as a graph parameter) placed at the point of the  Accumulated user story change to represent the new bottom\\nb.- A manually placed arrow from the top of remaining work at sprint 1 to the bottom reference at sprint n+1 (could be done an additional line series that doesn't stack and adjusting it's parameters to represent  the desired line)\\n\\n## done vs remaining\\nIn done vs remaining we wont move the bottom and the changes in story points are just added to the respective sprint (if the change is done at the end of sprint n, this will be reflected at the beginning of n+1).\\nWe differentiate the work done in a sprint from the change in user stories by stacking the done work on top of the remaining one. We do this using a _stacked column graph_.\\n\\nSo at the beginning of sprint 1 it should be only remaining work, in sprint 2 remaining work dropped by the number of completed story points and we stack a column of the height of the work done. The total height should clearly be the same, all the way to the end when we have only done work and zero remaining work, it looks like done work eats a part of the remaining work each sprint.\\n\\nWhen story points are added or removed from a sprint, the remaining work reflects at the time of the change. For example if I add 5 story points at the end of sprint 1, the remaining work bar is 5 points taller than it should be on sprint 2 onwards (pre_remaining - prev_work + change_story_points) since work done is the same size as it used to, the total height of the column in sprint 2 is now 5 points taller – this is what signifies the increased effort in points – if we remove story points, then the total height will be lower than the preceding sprint.\\n\\n\\nI hope this helped clearing some common pitfalls . \\nPlease disregard typos of grammar in this text as I wrote it in what little time I had today to help peers before the looming deadlines, and didn't had time for a simple proofread"

A bit long as I don't have time right now to carefully edit the text.\\n\\n# Release Burn-down chart:\\nRemember that this is different than the iteration burn-down chart, this confused me before a lot. \\n\\n# The prediction line:\\n\\nWhat's not: The prediction line is not the same as a trend line of remaining or work done, neither is it the graph of the total accumulated amount of fork on that sprint.\\n\\nWhat it is: It's just a line starting at the total amount of story points in the first sprint and ending in 0 story points the next sprint after development is supposed to end; if it's a \"moving bottom\" burn-down graph then consider that the starting and end points are relative to that moving bottom\\n\\nWhat it means: it's a  representation of the ideal work to end the project considering current knowledge of the amount of history points. It helps us know if the project is behind schedule considering the total amount of work to do now (the prediction line can start at a different height than remaining work at sprint 1).\\nIf the remaining work is over the prediction line, we are behind.\\n(We might not be able to make it as it stands because we decided to add a bunch of stories, that's not a judgement on how fast we were developing before the additions.)\\n\\n#Types of chart\\nRemaining vs done work and moving bottom. Both tackle the problem of changing in story points in different ways.\\n\\n## Moving bottom\\nIn moving bottom, there is a bese reference (horizontal) line that is moved to represent the current total story points vs the initial. If there are five net more story points, the reference \"bottom\" line is at -5, this means that you have to go down an extra 5 points to reach the new base or bottom; if there are less total story points it is moved up, so it's easier to reach the \"bottom\".\\nHow it can be graphed: there are many ways but i liked charting  _stacked columns graph_  with: \\n1.- remaining work —done work in sprint n is the difference between remaining work at the beginning of sprint n and n+1 —\\n2.- Accumulated user story change (inverted as described above) in the first order of the stack so that it's always next to the x axis.\\na.- An horizontal line (some software support a reference line as a graph parameter) placed at the point of the  Accumulated user story change to represent the new bottom\\nb.- A manually placed arrow from the top of remaining work at sprint 1 to the bottom reference at sprint n+1 (could be done an additional line series that doesn't stack and adjusting it's parameters to represent  the desired line)\\n\\n## done vs remaining\\nIn done vs remaining we wont move the bottom and the changes in story points are just added to the respective sprint (if the change is done at the end of sprint n, this will be reflected at the beginning of n+1).\\nWe differentiate the work done in a sprint from the change in user stories by stacking the done work on top of the remaining one. We do this using a _stacked column graph_.\\n\\nSo at the beginning of sprint 1 it should be only remaining work, in sprint 2 remaining work dropped by the number of completed story points and we stack a column of the height of the work done. The total height should clearly be the same, all the way to the end when we have only done work and zero remaining work, it looks like done work eats a part of the remaining work each sprint.\\n\\nWhen story points are added or removed from a sprint, the remaining work reflects at the time of the change. For example if I add 5 story points at the end of sprint 1, the remaining work bar is 5 points taller than it should be on sprint 2 onwards (pre_remaining - prev_work + change_story_points) since work done is the same size as it used to, the total height of the column in sprint 2 is now 5 points taller – this is what signifies the increased effort in points – if we remove story points, then the total height will be lower than the preceding sprint.\\n\\n\\nI hope this helped clearing some common pitfalls . \\nPlease disregard typos of grammar in this text as I wrote it in what little time I had today to help peers before the looming deadlines, and didn't had time for a simple proofread"
