I suggest to add every member to at least one coding task, where allready another mambers is assigned.\\n\\nTask distribution\\nAlexa has allready assigned 26 hours which is around 2 times the assigned hours of the other two. I suggest to remove here from one of the user stories to be more flexible.\\n\\nTotal hours\\nYou have a bit spare time left, thats good!\\n\\nDaniel\\nYou allready marked, where you need help from Daniel. I suggest to add him to the other task where you need help from as well, even if you do not know yet, who of you will do this task, but Daniel should know as early as possible if he has to help.\\nAdditionaly I suggest to perform the \"determination\" task as early as possible, so that there is enough time if something has to be prepare from Daniel or double check with LIsa\\n*****************\\n\\nPlease let me know, what your reaction to this \"plagiarism\" is.
